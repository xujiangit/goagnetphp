Ideally, this component can run on any platform that supports PHP. It
lies between meek-client and meek-server, and receives requests from the
client and forwards them to the server, then receives responses from the
server and forwards them to the client.

To test locally, run:
	php -S 127.0.0.1:8080

The app will be running at http://127.0.0.1:8080/. To configure
meek-client to talk to the locally running app, put this in torrc:
	UseBridges 1
	Bridge meek 0.0.2.0:1 url=http://127.0.0.1:8080/
	ClientTransportPlugin meek exec ./meek-client --log meek-client.log
