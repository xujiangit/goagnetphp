The file nginx.conf.example is an example configuration file for Nginx
that shows how to run multiple virtual-host domain names, with one of
them reflecting to an instance of meek-server. Clients can front behind
one of the ordinary domain names in order to reach the reflector domain.

Here is the matching client torrc configuration:
	UseBridges 1
	Bridge meek 0.0.2.0:1 url=https://meek-reflect.example.com/ front=www.example.com
	ClientTransportPlugin meek exec ./meek-client --log meek-client.log
